Galactic Conquest is a simple Turn-Based Strategy game where players take on the roles of commanding forces in a galaxy-wide conflict. Players must manage their fleets, fortify their planets, and outmaneuver their opponents to capture key locations and achieve dominance.

Based on the Galactic Conquest mode in Star Wars Battlefront II (2005). I'd like to make this a supplement to that game; use this for the Galactic Conquest mode and Instant Action in SWBFII to play through the game.

Eventually, I like the idea of making this a standalone game, but my focus for now is on making it a supplement.
